# fumbbl_scraping
This repository hosts the code that creates FUMBBL datasets scraped from https://www.fumbbl.com .
Scraping is semi-automated and is done at irregular intervals.

The repository [fumbb_datasets](https://github.com/gsverhoeven/fumbbl_datasets) contains the current and previous releases. 
see `CHANGELOG` in that repository for release details.

## Full code and documentation available

The Jupyter Notebooks `fumbbl_dataset*.ipynb` contains the current scraping and data processing code that produces the current release of the datasets.

The code creates a local folder `raw` to cache the raw data fetched from FUMBBL.

See https://gsverhoeven.github.io/post/blood-bowl-fumbbl-dataset/ for a data paper describing a previous version of the code (v0.1).
